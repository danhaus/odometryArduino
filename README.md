# odometryArduino

This is an Arduino code for an odometry robot. It uses MD25 motor driver with EMG30 motors for driving and getting the position, and 9g servo for releasing M&Ms. There are no other sensors. It drives on a path composed of straight and circular sections. The robot also drops M&Ms at five places marked on a track.
